## Project management

### Agile method.

- HerBody was developed using an agile method. That includes using GitHub issues, user stories and kanban boards.
- That gave me an overview of tasks structured in a to-do, in-progress and done way.

The project was divided in different iterations to divide the issues and the user stories in main Epic .
Inside each Iteration ( Epic ) developer created different issues , user stories, task and bugs , and differentiate the Iteration in diferent Boards.
